This is template for project's repository, where all the code should be maintaned. 
If there is a need for large file storage please use external resources.

Please implement logical structure of the project to make it easy to understand for teachers.

Please fill all phases according to the project of your project proposal.

# Phase 1

Derivables:
- Preparation of list of users  
- Scrapping tweets of users (What is a limit for dates? From the beginning of user creation?)  
- Initial data processing - how to aggregate all tweets for one user? Which NLP model to use for the embeddings? 


What was achieved:
- ...


# Phase 2

Derivables:
- Creation of embeddings for each user.  
- Implementation of machine learning model (most possible - unsupervised) that will classify/cluster embeddings  
- In-depth analysis of results of classification/clustering  


What was achieved:
- ...


# Phase 3

Derivables:
- Gathering all results and plots that were extracted during data analysis.  
- Implementation of website that includes results and plots  
- Deployment of website to public  
- Creation of poster

What was achieved:
- ...
